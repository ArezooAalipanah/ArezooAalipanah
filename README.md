- ⚡ About me ^-^: 
* A 25-year-old girl who loves escaping from reality by diving into books.
* Always criticizes herself for not working hard enough.
* Never gets tired of coding and running codes and debugging. 
* Started programming when she was 17 for the computer olympiad and has loved facing new challenges and solving new puzzles ever since. 
* Tries to face every difficult problem as if they are games and believes she is the main character of her own game. 
* Has a vision that she will put her mark on the earth and would be able to help as many people as she can.
* Climbing mount Everest and working in Barnes and Nobles are just 2 items on her 100-item bucket list.
